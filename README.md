# Hello! 👋 My name is Lucas Schmidt


I'm a Fullstack developer who enjoys creating intuitive user interfaces and rewarding digital experiences, based on well-established concepts of development programming and design. I love the challenge of connecting elegant front-ends with robust back-ends, building web and mobile applications that people actually want to use.

  * Improve my Flutter and Dart skills to create even more fluid and powerful mobile apps.
  * Explore the possibilities of development with C#, .NET, Angular and other front-end technologies.
  * To deepen my knowledge of software architecture, seeking scalable and efficient solutions. And to improve my project management, whether professional or personal.
  * Collaborate on innovative projects that allow me to learn and grow as a developer.
